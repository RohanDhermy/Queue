# Queue
This program shows a simulation of how call and support queueing will work for a call center. 
It asks the user to input the number of 
customers that will be in queue to begin with, the time interval for each call, 
the day of the week, and how many calls to handle in the simulation. The program 
creates mock ArrayLists of Customers and Techs and then creates a queue of 
customers and techs to be paired with each other. Once a call is taken care of,
the tech is put back into the tech queue and the customer is removed from the 
customer queue. Then we add new random customer to the customer queue.
